My project was creating a simple shell program using **fork()/execv()** system calls. It supports all the basic bash-like shell functions.

This shell program does not need any supporting files to run the program. The only thing necessary is the project file, named khan_project.cpp.

First, to compile the program, we have to run this command: *g++ -o programName source.cpp*. Here, "programName" can be anything and "source.cpp" needs to be replaced with "*khan_project.cpp*" as that is the name of the source file for my project. After compilation, we can type *./programName* to run the program. It will prompt the user to type in commands after running that command (in the same shell).

That is all there is to run this shell program.
